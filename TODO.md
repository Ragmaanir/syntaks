- Profiling context
    - self-time
    - children-time
    - self+children time
    - number of fails/success
    - count invocations of each rule
- Use String/IO/StringScanner
    - If IO: figure out how to use regex in that context
- Rename call to call_impl so profiling/logging code can be injected more easily
- BUG: parse log printing is too slow for large files
